Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Madeline Castro, a passionate front-end developer and designer. This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and academic experience in Computer Science and IT engineering.

## 🚀 Development

I developed this portfolio using modern web technologies and advanced design techniques to ensure a smooth and professional user experience. Special attention was paid to responsiveness and interactivity.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: Used to build the user interface with reusable components.
- **Vite**: Employed as a build tool for faster development and bundling.
- **Framer Motion**: Utilized for adding fluid animations to section transitions.
- **CSS**: For custom and responsive styling of the portfolio.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src/components`: Contains all reusable components such as buttons, cards, etc.
- `src/pages`: Includes components for experience, about me, and projects pages.
- `/assets`: Stores static resources like images and gifs.
